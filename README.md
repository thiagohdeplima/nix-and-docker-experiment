# Docker & Nix Experiment

This repo aims to run an environment that uses Nix to install basic and build tools, but, delegates to Poetry the installation of Python Packages, and run its all inside an container.

## Running this

To execute the result of it on your computer, just run `docker-compose up -d` and access [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000/).
